While this\nAPI is the future of offline storage, it is not very intuitive to use.\nIDBWrapper is there to provide easy access to IndexedDB's features.\n\n##Browser Support\n\nIDBWrapper works on all browsers supporting the IndexedDB API, which are:\n\n**Desktop**\n\n* Chrome\n* Firefox\n* Opera 15+\n* IE 10+\n* Safari 8+\n\n**Mobile**\n\n* Chrome for Android\n* Firefox for Android\n* Opera for Android\n* IE10 for WP8\n* iOS 8+\n\n**Worker** IDBWrapper runs inside of a worker on following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (also on Android)\n* Firefox (also on Android)\n* Opera (also on Android)\n* IE10+ (also on WP8+)\n\nIf using in an older browser supporting WebSql along with [IndexedDBShim](https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim), IndexedDBShim needs to run first.\n\nNote on limited/buggy IndexedDB support:\n\n* IE has limited support, which can be fixed by including [idb-iegap](https://github.com/dfahlander/idb-iegap)\n* Safari has buggy support, which can be fixed by using the above mentioned shim\n\n#Using IDBWrapper\n\n##Tutorials\n\nThere are two tutorials to get you up and running:\n\nPart 1: Setup and CRUD operations\nhttp://jensarps.de/2011/11/25/working-with-idbwrapper-part-1/\n\nPart 2: Running Queries against the store\nhttp://jensarps.de/2012/11/13/working-with-idbwrapper-part-2/\n\n##Examples\n\nThere are some examples to run right in your browser over here: http://jensarps.github.com/IDBWrapper/example/\n\nThe source for these examples are in the `example` folder of this repository.\n\n##Wiki\n\nFor usage instructions, details about mothods for reading and writing \ndata, setting up indexes and runnoing queries, please refer to the \n[Wiki](https://github.com/jensarps/IDBWrapper/wiki).\n\n##API Reference\n\nThere's an API reference over here: http://jensarps.github.com/IDBWrapper/jsdoc/IDBStore.html\n\n#Obtaining IDBWrapper\n\n##git\n\nYou can git clone the repository, or download a zip file here: https://github.com/jensarps/IDBWrapper/tags\n\n##cdnjs\n\nIDBWrapper is also available on [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/). You can directly \npoint a script tag there, or require() it from there. cdnjs supports http, \nhttps and spdy, so you can just leave the protocol off. The URLs for the \ndifferent versions of IDBWrapper can be found here: \n[https://cdnjs.com/libraries/idbwrapper](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/idbwrapper)\n\n##Package Managers\n\nIf you use NPM as your package manager, you can get it from there, too, by\nrunning:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install idb-wrapper\n```\n\nIf you use bower as your package manager, run the following:\n\n```bash\n$ bower install idbwrapper\n```\n\nIf you want to add IDBWrapper to a volo project, just run:\n\n```bash\n$ volo add idbwrapper\n```\n\n#License\n\n[MIT style (X11)](https://github.com/jensarps/IDBWrapper/blob/master/LICENSE)\n",
